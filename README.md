# My Qtile config

The main feature it has right now is dwm style toggling of groups.
Groups can be toggled either via keybind (mod + ctrl + group) or right-clicking on the GroupBox in the bar.

#### Note that currently this follows qtile master closely, so it may be using some bleeding-edge features 

### TODO
* [ ] Maybe write a custom GroupBox widget that will read the toggling state 
      and use a third color for groups that have been toggled.
